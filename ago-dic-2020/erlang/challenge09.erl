% ====================
% Complete the following functions and submit your file to Canvas.
% ====================
% Do not change the names of the functions.
% Do not change the number of arguments in the functions.
% If your file cannot be loaded by the Erlang compiler, your submission may be cancelled.

% ====================
% Grading instructions:
% There is a series of test cases for each function. In order to state that your function
% "works as described", your output must be similar to the expected one in each case.
